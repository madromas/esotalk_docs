# Upgrading

To upgrade esoTalk to the latest version, simply:

1. [Download](https://github.com/madromas/esoTalk-v3) the latest version of esoTalk.
2. Extract and upload all of the files to your web-server, overwriting old ones. (Be careful that you don't lose custom plugins, skins, and languages you've uploaded to the addons directory, though!).

## Troubleshooting

If you are having problems upgrading esoTalk, read the [Troubleshooting](/debug) page.
