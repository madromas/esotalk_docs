# Roadmap

esoTalk is being *maintained*, but not actively developed, by [@MadRomas](https://madway.net). Stability (bug-fixing) is the main goal of maintanence. I try to review [issues](https://github.com/madromas/esoTalk-v3/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/madromas/esoTalk-v3/pulls) regularly.
